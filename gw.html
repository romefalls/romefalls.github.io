    <h1>ST. PASADENA, OREGON, USA.</h1>
    <p>Once an unassuming little town in Lane County that now serves its purpose as a battleground. </p>

    <h1>THE M11 INSURGENCY</h1>
    <p>The M11 insurgency is a militant group that opposes corporate control and government overreach. 
        Their anger, rising against its next-door corporation, led them to gain their de facto trademark of brutality. <br>
        A vendetta of necessity.

    <h1>SYDNEY GRAY</h1>
    <blockquote>
        Let me ask you this:
        <br><br>
        If you were born into a world where everything you did was controlled by a fucker with a silk tie and a wretched smirk,
        <br>
        If you were told what to think, what to say, what to do
        <br>
        that your life was not your own
        <br>
        and that your dreams, your hopes, your aspirations were just that, and nothing more
        <br>
        what would you do?
        <br>
        What would be your choice?
        <br><br>
        I made mine.
        <br>
        Knowing full well there's no chance of me surviving.
        <br>
        And I'd do it again in the next life.

    <h1>C.O.R.E.</h1>
    <p>The Corporate Overreach Resistance Expulsion Act serves to open the floodgates for the fight against the M11 insurgency led by Sydney, 
        by marking them for death.
        <br>
        A cherry-picked arsenal of tactful killers in red, blue and gold teams all around. </p>
